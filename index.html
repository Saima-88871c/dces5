        <p>Daves Creek Elementary opened in 1996, but the building was not occupied by students until January, 1997. Ms. Marian Hicks was the first principal and the school was built to accommodate the overcrowding at Mashburn and Big Creek elementary schools. Daves Creek Elementary is named after the former Daves Creek School, which was named for the Daves Creek Mill. The grist mill exists today but is not active. Adjacent to the school campus is Joint Venture Park. The park opened in 2006 and is a partnership between the Forsyth County Board of Education and the Forsyth County Commissioners.</p>

Our Media Center operates on a flexible schedule which allows students to visit anytime during the day.

                        Daves Creek is an active school community. There's always something amazing happening here. Whether it's dynamite student projects, visiting speakers, cultural celebrations or PTA supported events, our school community is a fun place to learn.

                        We are pleased to offer a variety of after school activities for our students.. Please check out each of the pages to see requirements and meeting days.

                        Please check the meeting dates because there are several activities/teams that meet on the same days. Refunds will not be given.
